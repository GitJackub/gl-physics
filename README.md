# General Purpose

This repository was created to explore how objects behave in various physical environments, implement basic physics equations in practice, and improve C++ programming skills. The 3D rendering is based on OpenGL and utilizes libraries such as GLFW, GLM, and GLEW. The final version aims to implement a virtual physics sandbox.

## Requirements

Below is the set of libraries and the IDE used to develop this project. Using these versions ensures the code runs correctly:
- Visual Studio 2022
- GLEW 2.1.0
- GLFW 3.4 (Windows 64-bit)
- GLM 1.0.1

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/GitJackub/gl-physics.git`
2. Inside the `gl-physics/` directory, create a `libs/` folder.
3. Copy all the previously downloaded OpenGL libraries *(GLEW, GLFW, GLM) into the `libs/` folder.
4. Open the solution (`.sln` file) in Visual Studio 2022.
5. Build and run the project to execute the current version of the application.

\* To ensure that the Visual Studio project has the correct linked paths, name the folders exactly as follows:
  - `glew-2.1.0`
  - `glfw-3.4.bin.WIN64`
  - `glm`
